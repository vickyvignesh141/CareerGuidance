      <!-- Why Card -->
      <div class="card">
        <h2>🌟 Why Maatram Career Connect Was Born</h2>
        <p>Many students in India face the same challenge — scoring good marks but not knowing what comes next. They wonder whether to pursue engineering, arts, or another field, often without clear guidance. Some even compromise due to lack of financial support. That’s where our idea began.
Maatram Career Connect was born to solve this confusion. Our platform uses AI algorithms to evaluate a student’s performance, interests, and goals to recommend the best career paths. It doesn’t just suggest — it explains why a particular career is suitable. This ensures that students, parents, and mentors all understand the reasoning behind each recommendation.</p>

        <h2>❤️ Inspired by Maatram Foundation</h2>
        <p>Maatram Foundation has been a beacon of hope for thousands of students who dream big but come from humble backgrounds. Since its inception, the foundation has helped over 3,300 students pursue free higher education across Tamil Nadu. Inspired by this vision, we created Maatram Career Connect to continue that journey — from education access to career success. While Maatram Foundation ensures that deserving students get into good colleges, our platform ensures they choose the right career and stay motivated to reach their goals. Together, we are building a complete ecosystem of education, empowerment, and employment. </p>
